## About

Count the verses between two given points in the Bible. All counts include the starting and ending verses, meaning that if you start at `Genesis 1:1` and end at `Genesis 1:1`, one verse would be counted.

The name is an extremely lame pun, as reeds were used to measure things in Bible times.
